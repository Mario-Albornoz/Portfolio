# Portfolio with React + Vite
This is the code for my Portafolio developed with React + Vite and deployed with gitHub pages, Here you will find how the files are distributed and organized. Which is much different than any of my previous projects. Here you can also find the pdf of my personal Resume, as well as all the tools, models and outside open source code used to develop the portfolio.
